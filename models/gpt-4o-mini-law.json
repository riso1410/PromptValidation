My team was talking about forming an LLC to prevent getting sued for personal assets. Keep in mind, we do not make money from the app nor do we handle money (digital or otherwise) anywhere in the app, we just facilitate the communication between users buying\/selling similar items and it's up to the users to meet and fulfill their agreed upon transaction. An auction of sorts, like craigslist, but in the US only.I've been doing research on LLCs and it seems like forming an LLC will not 100% relieve us of legal responsibility of a transaction gone wrong. So I figured (to save spending unnecessary money) it would be possible to just place disclaimers *very* prominently throughout the app and item transaction process. In the event something goes wrong during the transaction, we will not be liable.Will that resolve us of blame\/responsibility of someone shouting \"your app ripped me off! I'm suing you!\"?",
