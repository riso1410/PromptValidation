Why can't you sue for potential injuries that might have occurred based on probability, despite the fact that you did not sustain injuries?Another example, let's say you almost get run over by a car, but don't. There was a very real probability that you may have been runover in that scenario, but you didn't. Why isn't there some civil repercussions for that?Maybe there is, but my understanding is that most law does not incorporate probability.\\* The original question included the word \"[s]tanding\" here which was not the proper term.",
